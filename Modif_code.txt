V1.3 New diagonalizaiton with Stark effect -d.E given by the dipole matrix. So the Hamiltonian is complex now (hermitian). In addition in case of positronium 
Improve user guide for this part in appendix. 



2020/08/10
V1.2 Put on github the new version. 
Simplify (a bit) the code. Removing  Sisyphus forced repumping, Franck_Condon part and the velocity scalling part
Put new ToDo list
Comment a bit more the List_Param and sortie_donnee with examples

2020/08/10
V1.0.2 Put on github the new version. 
Imporve the diagonalization to be more general in the futur

2020/08/07
Full 64bit compilation using msys2 mingw64 and package manager. All installation of gsl, Eigen and freeflut is simpler.
The code is modified to accomodate for this (freeglut especially)

2020/08/05
For 64bits compilation. Modify some stream and char comparaison (that are not supported aymore). 

2020/05/23
Modification of the definition of the dipole and laser parameters. Clarification of all notation in a new user Guide

2020/05/11
Some C++ part of the code are compilor dependant (Ask Pauline Yzombard)

2020/05/11
Test Ps diagonalization and put correct new levels, lines and matrix files 


2019/06/26
Imporved spontaneous emission in diagonalizaiton (using the proper photon energy k_spon)


2019/06/04

   Body &my_bod = bod[i]; in one_body (if not the position are not really apply to bod!)
   
   
   
   
   2019/01/04

test diagonalizaiton and polarization seems OK. Small modification and todo added


2018/11/11
ADD linear polarization adn new angle (psi) in the Laser definition. 
Thus more general laser deal or emission angle with (almost because still real numbers) arbitrary polarization is possible.
So in the case of Diagonalization fo  the hamiltonian the spontaneous emission is correct even for non pure circular emission



2018/09/17
In compiler -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition is required (for glut.h that is probably called multiple times ?)
The Eigen (better than GSL) library still create bugs !


2018/08/16
Adding possibility of diagonalization of the Energy of the states (so adding so matrix in Internal_State)
Big modification of the User Guide
SMALL_NUMBER_RATE_EXCITATION ~ 1 is added to control the rates that shall not be considered

2018/04/28
Add Hydrogen
Add anti-Helmholtz coils
ERREUR 3/2en 3 on brhosurrho= ERROR IN GRADIENT (when z goes to zeor the gradient (accceleartion) change signe)

2018/04/24
Add option Procedure_init_y (4) : perfect ordered gaussian in velocity (random in position)


2018/04/03
Add sigmaSB in Siconstantes
Add cross section

2017/08/28
Pseudo_BBR calcul of intensity = energy density/c

2017/08/21
Modify the factor 3 in E_tot=3 kB T for the Affichage_Mol


2017/07/08
Modify Draw Molecules for color and size (taille) to allow for Manifold >3 (100 max)


2017/06/30
Add a pseudo BBR laser.
The Power is like the integrated power (Stefan-Boltzmann's law sigma T^4 per surface: 1W/m^2 at 65K) emmited by a real BBR of a circular surface of diameter waist
The central energy has no meaning in this case even if the Wien's displacement law  states that the max frequency scales with temperature (Emax_cm-1 ~2 T).
So for simplicity 

2017/06/26
Possibility to initialise the thermal position in a harmonic trap for charged particles

2017/06/14
Verif Pgopher S Spol and A and (minor) correction in UserGuide

2016/07/23
Put the correct recoil (probability distrbution for the spontaneous emission depending on the polarization of the transition)
